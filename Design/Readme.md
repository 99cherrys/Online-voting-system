From the above use case diagram only two constituencies are considered. Each constituency consist of n-voters and m-candidates participating. Each voter can login into the portal only by using adhar number/voter-id and date of birth as individual credentials and can update/check/cast vote of that particular voter-account only. The admin can delete expired voter from the list, release list of candidates participating and read only the total number of votes for all candidates.
