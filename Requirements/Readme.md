## Introduction
 * Due to COVID-19 Pandemics, all the systems are continuing their processes via online mode, from e-learning to work at home corona changed all our major systems. This would have been impossible without enhancements of Smart Technologies and thanks to the Internet. If elections commence during these pandemic situation it is best to opt online voting system which is secured, fast, accurate and safe. 
 * This topic was chosen because it is simple and easy to implement also provides me to achieve the main aim of this project to gain flexibilty, efficiency and understand multiple C- programming concepts on Applied Project Based Learning approach.

## Research
### Traditional Ballot Voting System
Prior to the introduction of electronic voting, India used paper ballots and manual counting. A ballot is a simple scrap of paper on which each voter writes in the name of a candidate, but governmental elections use preprinted ballots to protect the secrecy of the votes. The voter casts their ballot in a box at a polling station. This system becomes more tedious and difficult to mannually count millions of votes. Also this system is not very secure, not confidential and there is lots of chance to caste multiple false votes.

### Trending Electronic Voting Machine System (EVM
The control unit is with the presiding officer or a polling officer and the balloting Unit is placed inside the voting compartment. The balloting unit presents the voter with blue buttons (momentary switch) horizontally labeled with corresponding party symbol and candidate names. The Control Unit, on the other hand, provides the officer-in-charge with a "Ballot" marked button to proceed to the next voter, instead of issuing a ballot paper to them. This activates the ballot unit for a single vote from the next voter in the queue. The voter has to cast his vote by once pressing the blue button on the balloting unit against the candidate and symbol of his choice.

As soon as the last voter has voted, the Polling Officer-in-charge of the Control Unit will press the 'Close' Button. Thereafter, the EVM will not accept any votes. Further, after the close of the poll, the Balloting Unit is disconnected from the Control Unit and kept separately. Votes can be recorded only through the Balloting Unit. Again the Presiding officer, at the close of the poll, will hand over to each polling agent present an account of votes recorded. At the time of counting of votes, the total will be tallied with this account and if there is any discrepancy, this will be pointed out by the Counting Agents. During the counting of votes, the results are displayed by pressing the 'Result' button. There are two safeguards to prevent the 'Result' button from being pressed before the counting of votes officially begins. (a) This button cannot be pressed till the 'Close' button is pressed by the Polling Officer-in-charge at the end of the voting process in the polling booth. (b) This button is hidden and sealed; this can be broken only at the counting center in the presence of a designated office.

### Benefits of adopting Online Voting System (OVS)
* Although EVMs are accurate and fast, proxy vote castings are possible because of manual verification of voters. These systems must also include automated authentication like finger print match check or face recognition check through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
* Online voting system is too fast, very acurate, secure, confidential.
* Voters can cast their votes wherever they are and also new voter-id can be created easily via Unique id like Adhar card number.
* Voter registered on his/her unique id Adhar number and also having unique voter-id can caste only one vote for a particular election.
* Election Commission admin can release the list of canditates in the portal for people to cast their vote of choice.
* Admin of Election Commission admin can only view the total vote counts and announce the result.

### Best Online Voting system
Authenting voters via finger print match or face recognition check makes this system perfectly equipped for online voting system. This can be implemented using AI and ML concepts 

### Ease burden on Election Commision
* Safe guarding EVMs by sealing it at every stage is a tedious task but OVS need not to be protected like EVMs.
* Vote Counts of each constituency polling can be fetched by the admins and announce the result immediately without any delays.

### Very beneficial for Voters
* Voters can cast their very easily in less time sitting anywhere irrespective of being in their native constituencies.
* The votes casted by each individual are confidential, even admins are denied of that.
